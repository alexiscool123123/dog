# interactive puppy

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/alexl20053/pen/eYqJwva](https://codepen.io/alexl20053/pen/eYqJwva).

This pen combines some ideas explored in my previous pens, 'interactive kitten' and 'point and click penguin'. The head and body uses separate sprite animation for turning, and they are timed so that the head turns before the body. Tail and legs positions are adjusted depending on the angle the dog is facing, and are also animated using keyframe animations. The dog turns clockwise or anti-clockwise depending on where the cursor is.
